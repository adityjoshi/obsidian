**Phase 1: Need Identification**

1. **Identify Need:** This step involves recognizing the problem or opportunity that the design project aims to address. It includes gathering information through client meetings and project goals.
    
2. **Problem Definition:** Here, the problem statement is formulated based on the information collected. This involves defining the objectives that should be quantifiable and measurable.
    

**Phase 2: Conceptualization & Planning**

1. **Brainstorming:** This step encourages creative solutions through brainstorming sessions.
    
2. **Drawing/Visualization:** After brainstorming, initial ideas are sketched and visualized.
    
3. **Functional Decomposition:** The problem is broken down into smaller, more manageable components.
    
4. **Morphological Chart:** This tool helps explore different possible solutions by systematically combining various elements.
    
5. **Decision Making:** The most suitable solution is selected based on the established criteria.
    
6. **Gantt Charts & CPM:** A project schedule is created using Gantt charts or Critical Path Method (CPM) to plan and manage the design process.
    

**Phase 3: Detailed Design**

1. **Detailed Analysis:** This step involves a thorough investigation of the chosen design solution.
    
2. **Simulate & Optimize:** Here, simulations are used to assess the design's performance and identify areas for improvement.
    
3. **Detail Specifications:** Technical specifications are created to guide the development of the design.
    
4. **Drawings, GD&T:** Engineering drawings and Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T) symbols are created to precisely communicate the design requirements.
    

**Phase 4: Testing & Evaluation**

1. **Prototype Fabrication:** A prototype is built to physically represent the design and enable further testing.
    
2. **Evaluate Performance:** The prototype’s functionality and performance are assessed against the design objectives.
    
3. **Iterate Process Steps:** Based on the evaluation results, the design process may revisit earlier stages to address shortcomings.
    
4. **Report/Deliver:** Finally, a formal design report is created to document the entire process, and the final design is delivered to the client.


**Phase 1: Define the Problem**

1. **Identify Need:** This step involves recognizing the impetus for the design project. It could stem from client consultation, recognition of a market gap, or the identification of a problem that needs solving.
2. **Problem Definition:** Here, the problem is articulated clearly and concisely. What exactly needs to be addressed? What are the expectations?

**Phase 2: Conceptualization**

3. **Conceptualization & Planning:** Brainstorming potential solutions is central to this stage. This is where creative thinking is encouraged and a broad range of ideas are explored.
4. **Preliminary Design:** Following the brainstorming, this step translates the chosen concepts into initial sketches and visualizations. Specifications are noted, including materials and functionalities.

**Phase 3: Development**

5. **Detailed Design:** Here, the preliminary designs are further refined. Technical specifications are created and analyses are conducted to ensure the design meets expectations.
    
6. **Prototyping:** A prototype, a three-dimensional model, is constructed to test the design's functionality and usability.
    

**Phase 4: Evaluation**

7. **Testing/Evaluation:** The prototype is rigorously assessed to determine if it meets the design objectives. Does it function as intended?
    
8. **Report/Deliver:** The design process is documented in a formal report. This report includes the findings from the testing/evaluation phase.
    

**Iteration**

The flowchart also highlights that the design process is iterative. The “Iterate Process Steps 2-7 as Needed” box indicates that designers may need to revisit previous stages based on the results of the testing and evaluation phase.


# Human Centred Design 

HCD which is also known as human centred design has 5 steps - 

# Design Thinking Process 

1 Empathise -  This is the first step of hcd. The purpose of this step is to conduct the interviews that give you an idea what people really care about. 
We need to empathize with their situations. 
*For eg*
If you want to help old age people, you might found out they want the ability to walk around.
In your conversation they might share with you different ways how you can do that 
Later in the interview dig down little deeper and, look for personal stories or situations where things become difficult.
Ideally you redo this process with other people with the same problem 

2 Define the Problem Statement - Looking at the interviews, you can understand the actual needs that people are trying to fulfil with certain activities.
One way to do this is by underlining the activities and the patterns people mentioned when they are talking about the problems. 
		• like going for a walk
		• meeting old friends for tea
		• simply going grocery shopping around the corner
		store
It's not much about going out its all about staying in touch.
After your analysis, formulate a problem statement:
**Some elderly are afraid to be lonely. The want to stay connected**

3 Ideate : Now focus on the problem statement only and come up with ideas that solve the problem.
The point is not to get a perfect idea, but rather to come up with as many ideas as possible.
This involves brainstorming sessions and sketching ideas. The goal is to come up with as many ideas as possible fostering creativity.
Like designing a old people friendly hoverboard and modified pushcar.
Whatever you have in your mind design it and and show it to the people whom you are trying to help and get their feedback.

4 Prototype : Now take a moment and look what you have learned from your conversations about different ideas.
Your solution could be a combination of the new idea and what is already being used in the market. 
Then connect the dots, sketch up your final solution and go build a real prototype that's just good enough to be tested.

5 Test : Now test your prototype with the actual users. 
Don't defend your ideas in case people didn't like it 
The aim is to learn what works and what not so any feedback is great. 
Then go back to ideation or prototyping and apply your learning.
Repeat the process until you have a prototype that works and solves the real problem..



# Mind Mapping 
Graphical representation of the information 
Used to represent how the ideas or other items are connected to the central idea and to each other. 
Mind maps are used to generate, visualise, structure, and classify ideas to look for patterns and insights that provide key design criteria.

Why Should I Mind Map?

• Mind maps structure information

• Mind maps enhance productivity

• Mind maps foster creativity

• Mind maps improve memory and recall

# SCAMPER 
Scamper is the technique used by many to ignite the silent creative genius lying inside them.

# Types of Design / Design Types
Conceptual Design is a process of designing at the earliest stage. In this process, a detailed outline of different design functions is figured out. The conceptual design includes designing different processes and interactions in a particular activity.

**Conceptual Design**
1 - Identification of customer needs - The goal of this is to identify the customer needs 
2 - Problem Definition - to create a statement that tells what has to be accomplished to satisfy the needs of the customer. This involves analysis of competitive products, the listing of constraints and trade-offs.
➢ Quality function deployment (QFD) - a valuable tool for linking customer needs with design requirements.
➢ Product Design Specification (PDS) - A detailed listing of the product requirements
3 - Gathering Information - To acquire broad information.
4 - Conceptualisation - It involves creating a broad set of concepts that satisfies the problem statement
5 - Concept Selection -  Evaluation of the design concepts, modifying and evolving into a single preferred concept, are the activities in this step.
6 - Refinement of the PDS : The product design specification is revisited after the concept has been selected. The design team must commit to achieving certain critical values of design parameters, usually called critical-to-quality (CTQ) parameters, and to living with trade-offs between cost and performance.
7 -  Design review : Before committing funds to move to the next design phase, a design review will be held. The design review will assure that the design is physically realisable and that it is economically worthwhile. It will also look at a detailed product-development schedule. This is needed to devise a strategy to minimise product cycle time and to identify the resources in people, equipment, and money needed to complete the project.

**Embodiment Design** 
The next phase of the design process is often called Embodiment Design . It is the phase where the design concept is invested with physical form, where we “**put meat on the bones**". Here the design is converted into the system or product. 

**1 Product Architecture** : It refers to the fundamental structure and arrangement of components within a physical product. The idea is to map the product's functions and features, rather than the product's physical design. Professionals can express a product's architecture using schematic diagrams or other visual aids.

***Types of product architecture*** 
Modular : It is focuses on the relationships between the various features of a product.These functions are described briefly, while the ways that they interact are described in depth.

❖ Integral: Integral architecture is just the opposite: it focuses on the function, purpose, and inner workings of each feature, with brief notes covering the relationships between them .

***Benefits of using product architecture***

❖ Highlighting features that are no longer useful so the team can remove and replace them

❖ Design team to customize the product depending on users' preferences and needs

❖ Making it possible to revise or reconfigure a module or element without impacting the entire project

❖ Developing sustainable products with dynamic capabilities and long lifespans

❖ Helping save time and reduce production costs

❖ Improving the functional performance of a product

**2 Configuration Design** 
Configuration design is a type of design activity in which a set of predefined components can be combined in certain ways to design a system

Standard Part - A standard part is one that has a generic function and manufactured routinely without regard to a particular product.
Special Part - A special part is designed for a specific purpose. 
Assembly - An assembly is the collection of two or more parts. 
Sub assembly - A sub assembly is an assembly that is included within an assembly 
A standard assembly is an assembly or subassembly that has a generic function and is manufactured routinely.
Eg - electric motors and pumps . 
**design of a component cannot proceed very far without making decisions about the material and the manufacturing process from which it will be made.**

**3 Parametric Design** 
Parametric design is a design method where features (such as building elements and engineering components) are shaped according to **algorithmic processes**, in contrast to being designed directly.
1. Formulate the parametric design problem.

2. Generate alternative designs.

3. Analyse the alternative designs

4. Evaluate the results of the analyses

5. Refine/Optimize

# Design Features 
1 Aesthetic Design - It is the branch of **philosophy** that deals with the nature of art, beauty and taste. There is a phenomenon that social psychologists call **“the halo effect”**.
Good looking products and user interface are perceived as more valuable and having more
qualities.

Beauty is in the eye of **beholder**. It's not only restricted to the eyesight. It is broken down into 4 parts . 
	1 - Vision : The most dominant sense in majority of people is our sight. We
		 can’t stop ourselves to look at what we find beautiful. Visual aesthetics have these key elements: Colour, Shape, Pattern, Line, Texture, Visual weight, Balance, Scale, Proximity and Movement.
	 2 - Hearing : The ability to hear how you car engine works  how the digital product notifies     you of new messages and etc. This is the power of sound aesthetics. Sound aesthetics have these key elements: Loudness, Pitch, Beat, Repetition, Melody, Pattern and Noise. Using them well will create enjoyable “music” for our users.
	 3 - Touch : Skin is the largest organ of the human body. Just remember the last time you are buying the clothes and checking the texture or you are buying the clothes and checking its shape, size, design and feeling the frame material.
	 
***Material aesthetics key elements are: Texture, Shape, Weight, Comfort, Temperature, Vibration and Sharpness.***
	4 - Taste and Smell : Taste and Smell are sense that help us experience aesthetics even more deeply. Especially in food industry and different environment designs, these senses play an important role in experiencing aesthetics.

## Design For Production 
1 Relationship between design and production : Design for production means designing for the minimisation of the production cost without affecting the product quality.

Benefits

❖ Products made with design for production will have a lower production cost

❖ Quicker time-to-market

❖ Shortening of the product development process

❖ Production will be up to speed sooner

❖ Parts may be combined to reduce assembly steps and quantity of parts

❖ Catches and removes mistakes or faults

❖ Higher quality of a product, as design can be refined and enhanced at every stage

❖ As construction activities can be removed from a site and placed elsewhere, design for production can create a safer working environment

# Design For Maintenance
Design for maintenance should never compromise safety. In principle, the following aims are
important:
• Prevent damage and increase reliability.
• Avoid the possibility of errors during disassembly, reassembly and start-up.
• Simplify service procedures.
• Make the results of servicing checkable.
• Simplify inspection procedures.

# Design for minimum risk 
1. **Identify Hazards**: Conduct a thorough analysis to spot potential risks.
2. **Implement Safeguards**: Integrate fail-safes and redundancy to prevent accidents.
3. **Simplify Interaction**: Design intuitive interfaces and clear instructions.
4. **Prioritize Durability**: Use robust materials and construction methods.
5. **Adhere to Standards**: Ensure compliance with safety regulations and industry norms.

# User Requirement 
Surveys– both open-ended and focused surveys, conducted electronically or on paper.

**Interviews**– typically conducted face-to-face, but also over the telephone if deemed more appropriate.
**Focus groups** –  focus groups are useful for discussing possible user requirements and brainstorming ideas.
**Field studies** – observing the end-user situation and the environment in which a new product or system will be used is often extremely useful in understanding user needs.
**Evaluation of an existing product** – provides a range of useful information (even competitor products can be tested). Usability evaluation reveals and clarifies good and bad aspects of current solutions- valuable input to new design work.
**Customer journey mapping** - visualising the complete process that users go through to achieve their goal and identifying areas for improvement. The resulting map covers user experiences and interactions both with the product/service and related touch points (e.g. sales/support).
**Task analysis** – a deeper analysis of users work with a system, useful for analysing how user's work tasks should be supported by functionality in a system.

# User Experience 
Usability is concerned with the“effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction with which specified users achieve specified goals in particular environments

In terms of a web site, the aim of usability is to make that web site easy to use whilst the aim of user experience is to make the user happy before, during and after using that web site.

Usability can be modelled as the question“**Can the user accomplish their goal**?” whilst user experience can be phrased as “**Did the user have as delightful an experience as possible?**”

Usability refers to how successfully a user can use a product to accomplish a specific goal. User
experience encompasses an end user's entire experience with a product— not just how well the product worked, but how they expected it to work, how they feel about using it, and how they feel about the company overall.

# Usability Testing 
Usability testing is the most common technique to check how usable your interface is from the
human centre design framework.
Usability testing is Evaluating a product by testing it on users

The objectives of this technique are:

• Gain insights from our users

• See if we meet user’s expectations

• Check if the design is matching business decision to real world use

• Check if the user can perform the tasks we proposed

• Find out if we’re on the right track

• Get user reactions and feedback

# CUSTOMER CO-CREATION 
Customer co-creation, also known as co-creation of value, is a collaborative process in which companies and their customers work together to create value through the development, customization, or enhancement of products, services, or experiences.
