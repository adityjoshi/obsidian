# Analyze the differences between method overloading and method overriding in Java.


Provide examples to illustrate each concept, including method signatures showing both
overloading and overriding. Discuss when and why each technique should be used in
object-oriented design.
Certainly! Let's analyze the differences between method overloading and method overriding in Java, along with examples for each concept, and discuss when and why each technique should be used in object-oriented design.

### Method Overloading

**Definition**: Method overloading occurs when multiple methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters (different type, number, or both).

**Key Points**:
- Overloading is resolved at compile time (compile-time polymorphism).
- Methods can have the same name but must have different parameter lists.
- Return type can be the same or different.

**Example**:
```java
public class Calculator {
    // Method to add two integers
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    // Overloaded method to add three integers
    public int add(int a, int b, int c) {
        return a + b + c;
    }

    // Overloaded method to add two doubles
    public double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calculator calc = new Calculator();
        System.out.println("Sum of 2 and 3: " + calc.add(2, 3));
        System.out.println("Sum of 1, 2, and 3: " + calc.add(1, 2, 3));
        System.out.println("Sum of 1.5 and 2.5: " + calc.add(1.5, 2.5));
    }
}
```

### Method Overriding

**Definition**: Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass.

**Key Points**:
- Overriding is resolved at runtime (runtime polymorphism).
- The method in the subclass must have the same name, return type, and parameter list as in the superclass.
- The overriding method can provide a specific implementation that replaces the superclass's method.

**Example**:
```java
class Animal {
    // Method to make a sound
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Some generic animal sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    // Overriding the makeSound method in the subclass
    @Override
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Bark");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    // Overriding the makeSound method in the subclass
    @Override
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Meow");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myDog = new Dog();
        Animal myCat = new Cat();
        myDog.makeSound(); // Outputs: Bark
        myCat.makeSound(); // Outputs: Meow
    }
}
```

### When and Why to Use Each Technique

#### Method Overloading
- **When to Use**: Use method overloading when you need multiple methods with the same functionality but different parameters. This improves code readability and usability by allowing the same method name to handle different types or numbers of inputs.
- **Why**: Overloading provides a way to use the same method name for different operations, which can be intuitive and reduce the number of method names needed in a class.

#### Method Overriding
- **When to Use**: Use method overriding when you want to provide a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in a superclass. This is common in inheritance when subclasses need to offer their own version of a method.
- **Why**: Overriding is essential for runtime polymorphism, which allows a subclass to define specific behavior for a method while still adhering to a common interface. This enables dynamic method dispatch, where the method to be executed is determined at runtime based on the object's actual type.

### Summary

- **Method Overloading**: Same method name, different parameter list, resolved at compile time.
  - Example: Multiple `add` methods in the `Calculator` class with different parameters.
  
- **Method Overriding**: Same method name, same parameter list, resolved at runtime.
  - Example: Subclasses `Dog` and `Cat` overriding the `makeSound` method from the `Animal` class.

Both techniques are fundamental in object-oriented design, enhancing code flexibility, readability, and reusability. Overloading is used for method signatures that vary in parameters, while overriding is used to provide specific implementations in subclasses.

# interface vs abstraction
### Scenario 1: Providing Default Behavior

**Abstract classes** are particularly useful when you want to provide a default behavior that can be inherited and potentially overridden by subclasses. This scenario is common when you have a base class that defines some common functionality that is shared by multiple derived classes. The abstract class can provide default implementations for some methods while requiring subclasses to implement others.

### Example: Animal Class

Consider an application that models different types of animals. All animals can eat, but each type of animal makes a different sound. We can define an abstract class `Animal` that provides a default implementation for the `eat` method and requires subclasses to implement the `makeSound` method.

```java
abstract class Animal {
    // Default implementation for the eat method
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }

    // Abstract method that must be implemented by subclasses
    abstract void makeSound();
}

// Subclass representing a Dog
class Dog extends Animal {
    // Implementing the abstract method makeSound
    @Override
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Bark");
    }
}

// Subclass representing a Cat
class Cat extends Animal {
    // Implementing the abstract method makeSound
    @Override
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Meow");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myDog = new Dog();
        Animal myCat = new Cat();

        myDog.eat();       // Output: This animal eats food.
        myDog.makeSound(); // Output: Bark

        myCat.eat();       // Output: This animal eats food.
        myCat.makeSound(); // Output: Meow
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Abstract Class `Animal`**:
   - The `Animal` class is declared abstract, meaning it cannot be instantiated directly.
   - It provides a default implementation for the `eat` method, which prints a message indicating that the animal eats food.
   - It declares an abstract method `makeSound`, which does not have an implementation. Subclasses must provide their own implementation for this method.

2. **Concrete Subclasses `Dog` and `Cat`**:
   - Both `Dog` and `Cat` extend the `Animal` class and provide specific implementations for the `makeSound` method.
   - The `Dog` class overrides `makeSound` to print "Bark", while the `Cat` class overrides `makeSound` to print "Meow".

3. **Usage**:
   - In the `Main` class, instances of `Dog` and `Cat` are created and assigned to variables of type `Animal`.
   - Both the `eat` method and the `makeSound` method are called on these instances.
   - The `eat` method uses the default implementation provided by the `Animal` class.
   - The `makeSound` method uses the specific implementations provided by the `Dog` and `Cat` classes.

### Why Use an Abstract Class in This Scenario?

- **Default Behavior**: The `Animal` class provides a default behavior for the `eat` method that can be shared across all subclasses, avoiding code duplication.
- **Enforcing a Contract**: By declaring `makeSound` as an abstract method, the `Animal` class enforces that all subclasses must implement this method, ensuring that every specific type of animal can make a sound.
- **Extensibility**: The design allows for easy extension. New animal types can be added by simply extending the `Animal` class and providing implementations for the abstract methods, while automatically inheriting the default behavior.

Using an abstract class in this scenario provides a clear, organized, and maintainable structure for defining shared behaviors and enforcing specific requirements across multiple related classes.

## Interface 
Using an interface instead of an abstract class in the given scenario might seem like a viable option initially, but there are several reasons why an abstract class is more appropriate. Let's delve into why an interface would not be as suitable in this particular case:

### Key Points

1. **Default Method Implementation**:
   - Abstract classes can provide concrete (default) method implementations.
   - In our scenario, the `Animal` class provides a default implementation for the `eat` method, which is common to all animals. If we used an interface, we would not be able to provide this default implementation in the same straightforward manner, especially prior to Java 8.

2. **State Management (Fields)**:
   - Abstract classes can have member variables (fields) to store state.
   - If the `Animal` class needed to maintain some common state (e.g., `name`, `age`), it could directly define fields for this purpose. Interfaces cannot have instance variables; they can only have static final constants.
   - If we wanted to use state in interfaces, we would need to manage it separately in each implementing class, leading to potential code duplication and increased complexity.

3. **Shared Code**:
   - Abstract classes allow for shared code across multiple subclasses.
   - Any common behavior or utility methods can be implemented once in the abstract class and inherited by all subclasses.
   - Interfaces, on the other hand, do not allow for shared code implementation (though Java 8 introduced default methods, which partially address this limitation but are less powerful and flexible than abstract classes).

### Example with Interface (Not Ideal)

To illustrate why an interface is not ideal, let's see how the example would look if we used an interface instead:

```java
interface Animal {
    // Cannot provide a default implementation directly in an interface (prior to Java 8)
    // Abstract method to be implemented by subclasses
    void eat();

    // Abstract method to be implemented by subclasses
    void makeSound();
}

class Dog implements Animal {
    @Override
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }

    @Override
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Bark");
    }
}

class Cat implements Animal {
    @Override
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }

    @Override
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Meow");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myDog = new Dog();
        Animal myCat = new Cat();

        myDog.eat();       // Output: This animal eats food.
        myDog.makeSound(); // Output: Bark

        myCat.eat();       // Output: This animal eats food.
        myCat.makeSound(); // Output: Meow
    }
}
```

### Issues with Using an Interface

1. **Code Duplication**:
   - The `eat` method is implemented in both `Dog` and `Cat` classes, leading to code duplication. Every new animal class would have to implement the `eat` method, even though it is the same for all animals.

2. **Lack of Default Implementation**:
   - Interfaces cannot provide a default implementation for methods in the same way abstract classes can (prior to Java 8). Even with Java 8 default methods, the ability to share common implementation logic is more restricted and less intuitive compared to abstract classes.

### Summary

In this scenario, an abstract class is more appropriate because it allows you to:

- Provide a common default implementation for the `eat` method.
- Share common code and behavior among subclasses.
- Maintain state if needed through member variables.

An interface, while useful for defining contracts and enabling multiple inheritance, is less suitable for scenarios where shared behavior and state management are required across multiple related classes. Abstract classes offer a more straightforward and maintainable approach in such cases.

# Question 
Certainly! Let's start with an example block of code that reads user input and performs arithmetic operations. I'll then identify and correct any errors and explain the role of Java operators in the corrections.

### Example Code with Errors

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ArithmeticOperations {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter the first number: ");
        int num1 = scanner.nextInt();

        System.out.print("Enter the second number: ");
        int num2 = scanner.nextInt();

        // Performing arithmetic operations
        int sum = num1 + num2;
        int difference = num1 - num2;
        int product = num1 * num2;
        float quotient = num1 / num2; // Potential error here
        int remainder = num1 % num2;

        // Printing the results
        System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
        System.out.println("Difference: " + difference);
        System.out.println("Product: " + product);
        System.out.println("Quotient: " + quotient); // Potential error here
        System.out.println("Remainder: " + remainder);

        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

### Identifying and Correcting Errors

1. **Division and Quotient Calculation**:
   - The division operation `num1 / num2` is performed with integer operands, resulting in integer division, which might not be the desired behavior when working with floating-point results.
   - To fix this, cast one or both operands to `float` or `double` to perform floating-point division.

2. **Division by Zero**:
   - The code does not handle the potential division by zero error when `num2` is zero. This should be handled to prevent runtime exceptions.

### Corrected Code

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ArithmeticOperations {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter the first number: ");
        int num1 = scanner.nextInt();

        System.out.print("Enter the second number: ");
        int num2 = scanner.nextInt();

        // Performing arithmetic operations
        int sum = num1 + num2;
        int difference = num1 - num2;
        int product = num1 * num2;
        float quotient = 0;

        if (num2 != 0) {
            quotient = (float) num1 / num2; // Casting to float to perform floating-point division
        } else {
            System.out.println("Division by zero is not allowed.");
        }

        int remainder = 0;
        if (num2 != 0) {
            remainder = num1 % num2;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Modulus by zero is not allowed.");
        }

        // Printing the results
        System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
        System.out.println("Difference: " + difference);
        System.out.println("Product: " + product);
        if (num2 != 0) {
            System.out.println("Quotient: " + quotient);
            System.out.println("Remainder: " + remainder);
        }

        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Corrections and Java Operators

1. **Addition (`+`)**:
   - The `+` operator adds two operands. No corrections were needed for this operation as it was correctly implemented.

2. **Subtraction (`-`)**:
   - The `-` operator subtracts the second operand from the first. No corrections were needed for this operation as it was correctly implemented.

3. **Multiplication (`*`)**:
   - The `*` operator multiplies two operands. No corrections were needed for this operation as it was correctly implemented.

4. **Division (`/`)**:
   - The `/` operator divides the first operand by the second. The original code performed integer division because both operands were of type `int`. To perform floating-point division, one operand is cast to `float`: `(float) num1 / num2`.
   - Added a check to handle division by zero to prevent runtime exceptions: `if (num2 != 0)`.

5. **Modulus (`%`)**:
   - The `%` operator returns the remainder of the division of the first operand by the second. Added a check to handle modulus by zero to prevent runtime exceptions: `if (num2 != 0)`.

6. **Casting**:
   - Casting is used to convert one data type to another. In this case, `(float) num1` is used to cast the integer `num1` to a float to perform floating-point division.

### Conclusion

This example demonstrates how Java operators are used in arithmetic operations and the importance of handling potential errors, such as division by zero. Proper casting ensures that operations yield the desired results, especially when dealing with different data types.

# Switch over if else 
Here is a Java program that simulates a simple calculator using switch statements. After the program, I'll discuss the advantages and limitations of using switch statements over if-else statements in this scenario.

### Simple Calculator Program

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class SimpleCalculator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter the first number: ");
        double num1 = scanner.nextDouble();

        System.out.print("Enter the second number: ");
        double num2 = scanner.nextDouble();

        System.out.print("Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): ");
        char operator = scanner.next().charAt(0);

        double result = 0;
        boolean validOperation = true;

        switch (operator) {
            case '+':
                result = num1 + num2;
                break;
            case '-':
                result = num1 - num2;
                break;
            case '*':
                result = num1 * num2;
                break;
            case '/':
                if (num2 != 0) {
                    result = num1 / num2;
                } else {
                    System.out.println("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.");
                    validOperation = false;
                }
                break;
            default:
                System.out.println("Error: Invalid operator.");
                validOperation = false;
                break;
        }

        if (validOperation) {
            System.out.println("The result is: " + result);
        }

        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Scanner Class**:
   - The `Scanner` class is used to read user input from the console.

2. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads two numbers and an operator from the user.

3. **Switch Statement**:
   - The switch statement evaluates the operator and performs the corresponding arithmetic operation.
   - `case` labels handle different operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
   - The `default` label handles invalid operators.
   - Division by zero is explicitly checked to prevent runtime errors.

### Advantages of Using Switch Statements

1. **Readability**:
   - Switch statements can be more readable than a series of if-else statements when checking a variable against multiple possible values. Each case is clearly delineated, making it easier to see all possible operations.

2. **Performance**:
   - In some cases, switch statements can be more efficient than if-else chains, especially if there are many conditions to check. The JVM can optimize switch statements using jump tables or lookup tables.

3. **Simplicity**:
   - Switch statements provide a straightforward way to execute different code paths based on the value of a single variable. This can make the logic simpler to follow and maintain.

### Limitations of Using Switch Statements

1. **Limited to Certain Data Types**:
   - Switch statements in Java can only be used with a limited set of data types: primitive types (byte, short, int, and char), enumerated types (enum), and strings. They cannot be used with complex conditions or non-primitive types.

2. **Complex Conditions**:
   - If the conditions are complex or involve ranges or relational operators, switch statements are not suitable. For example, if you need to check if a number is within a certain range, an if-else statement is more appropriate.

3. **Maintainability**:
   - For very large numbers of cases, switch statements can become unwieldy and harder to maintain. In such scenarios, using polymorphism or a map of functions might be a better approach.

### Conclusion

Switch statements are useful for scenarios where you need to execute different code paths based on the value of a single variable, particularly when there are multiple discrete values to check. They offer advantages in terms of readability and, potentially, performance. However, they are limited to certain data types and are not suitable for complex conditions. For more complex logic, if-else statements or other design patterns may be more appropriate.

# Q for each loop vs normal loop

```java
package code.oops.assignment;  
  
import java.util.ArrayList;  
import java.util.Scanner;  
  
public class p16 {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);  
        ArrayList<Integer> arr = new ArrayList<Integer>();  
        System.out.println("Enter the numbers write d to exit");  
  
        while(in.hasNextInt()) {  
            arr.add(in.nextInt());  
        }  
        int sum = 0;  
        for(int num: arr){  
            sum += num;  
        }  
        System.out.println(sum);  
    }  
}
```

### Simplification with For-Each Loop

Using the for-each loop simplifies the code by removing the need for explicit index management and making the iteration more readable and concise. Here’s how:

- **No Index Variable**: The for-each loop eliminates the need for an index variable (`i`).
- **Direct Access**: It allows direct access to each element in the collection without needing to call `get(i)`.
- **Readability**: The for-each loop clearly expresses the intention to iterate over all elements in the collection, making the code easier to read and understand.

By using the for-each loop, the code becomes cleaner and less error-prone, focusing on the logic of summing the numbers rather than on the mechanics of iteration.

# Q for loop vs while loop 
In Java, both `while` loops and `for` loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a condition. However, they are suited for different scenarios and have distinct syntactic structures. Here's a comparison of the two, along with examples to illustrate scenarios where each would be more appropriate.

### While Loop

A `while` loop repeats a block of code as long as the specified condition is `true`. It is more flexible in terms of initialization and increment/decrement, making it suitable for scenarios where the number of iterations is not known in advance.

#### Syntax

```java
while (condition) {
    // Code to be executed
}
```

#### Example

Here's an example where a `while` loop is used to read integers from user input until the user enters a negative number:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class WhileLoopExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int sum = 0;
        
        System.out.println("Enter numbers to sum (enter a negative number to stop):");

        int number = scanner.nextInt();
        while (number >= 0) {
            sum += number;
            number = scanner.nextInt();
        }

        System.out.println("The sum is: " + sum);
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

### For Loop

A `for` loop is generally used when the number of iterations is known before entering the loop. It is more structured, as it allows initialization, condition checking, and increment/decrement in a single line.

#### Syntax

```java
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // Code to be executed
}
```

#### Example

Here's an example where a `for` loop is used to calculate the sum of the first 10 natural numbers:

```java
public class ForLoopExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int sum = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            sum += i;
        }

        System.out.println("The sum of the first 10 natural numbers is: " + sum);
    }
}
```

### Comparison and Use Cases

#### Use Case 1: While Loop

**Scenario**: Reading Input Until a Condition is Met

A `while` loop is more appropriate when the number of iterations is not known beforehand and depends on dynamic conditions, such as reading input until a specific value is encountered.

**Example**: Reading numbers until a negative number is entered, as shown above.

#### Use Case 2: For Loop

**Scenario**: Iterating a Fixed Number of Times

A `for` loop is more appropriate when the number of iterations is predetermined, such as iterating through a range of numbers or a fixed-size collection.

**Example**: Summing the first 10 natural numbers, as shown above.

### Advantages and Limitations

#### While Loop

**Advantages**:
- Flexibility: Initialization, condition, and increment can be placed anywhere in the loop body, offering greater flexibility.
- Suitable for dynamic conditions where the number of iterations is not known in advance.

**Limitations**:
- Less structured: Since initialization and increment/decrement are not part of the loop structure, it can be less readable and more prone to errors if not properly managed.

#### For Loop

**Advantages**:
- Structure: Initialization, condition, and increment/decrement are all in one place, making the loop more readable and easier to manage.
- Clear intention: It clearly specifies the number of iterations, making it ideal for loops with a known number of iterations.

**Limitations**:
- Less flexible: It is less flexible for situations where the number of iterations is not known beforehand or depends on dynamic conditions.

### Conclusion

Both `while` loops and `for` loops have their own advantages and are suited for different scenarios. `While` loops offer flexibility and are better for conditions where the number of iterations is not known in advance, while `for` loops provide structure and clarity, making them ideal for scenarios where the number of iterations is known beforehand. Choosing the appropriate loop depends on the specific requirements of the task at hand.

# java vs c++
Java and C++ are both powerful object-oriented programming languages, but they have several key differences in their approach to object-oriented features. Here, we'll analyze some of these differences and provide code snippets to illustrate them.

### Key Differences

1. **Memory Management**:
   - **Java**: Automatic garbage collection handles memory management.
   - **C++**: Manual memory management using pointers, `new`, and `delete`.

2. **Multiple Inheritance**:
   - **Java**: Does not support multiple inheritance directly through classes but allows it through interfaces.
   - **C++**: Supports multiple inheritance directly through classes.

3. **Polymorphism**:
   - **Java**: Polymorphism is achieved through method overriding and interfaces.
   - **C++**: Polymorphism is achieved through method overriding and virtual functions.

4. **Access Modifiers**:
   - **Java**: Uses `public`, `protected`, `private`, and package-private (default) access modifiers.
   - **C++**: Uses `public`, `protected`, and `private`.

5. **Constructors and Destructors**:
   - **Java**: Has constructors but no destructors (uses `finalize` method which is rarely used).
   - **C++**: Has constructors and destructors for resource management.

### Code Snippets

#### 1. Memory Management

**Java**:

```java
public class MemoryManagement {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Java handles memory management automatically
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
    }
}

class MyClass {
    // Constructor
    MyClass() {
        System.out.println("Constructor called");
    }

    // finalize method (called by garbage collector before object is destroyed)
    protected void finalize() {
        System.out.println("Finalize called");
    }
}
```

**C++**:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass() {
        cout << "Constructor called" << endl;
    }

    ~MyClass() {
        cout << "Destructor called" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    MyClass* obj = new MyClass();
    delete obj;  // Manual memory management
    return 0;
}
```

#### 2. Multiple Inheritance

**Java** (using interfaces):

```java
interface Interface1 {
    void method1();
}

interface Interface2 {
    void method2();
}

class MyClass implements Interface1, Interface2 {
    public void method1() {
        System.out.println("Method1");
    }

    public void method2() {
        System.out.println("Method2");
    }
}

public class MultipleInheritance {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
        obj.method1();
        obj.method2();
    }
}
```

**C++**:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base1 {
public:
    void method1() {
        cout << "Method1" << endl;
    }
};

class Base2 {
public:
    void method2() {
        cout << "Method2" << endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base1, public Base2 {
};

int main() {
    Derived obj;
    obj.method1();
    obj.method2();
    return 0;
}
```

#### 3. Polymorphism

**Java**:

```java
class Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Animal sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class Polymorphism {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal a = new Dog();
        a.makeSound();  // Dog barks
    }
}
```

**C++**:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Animal {
public:
    virtual void makeSound() {
        cout << "Animal sound" << endl;
    }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void makeSound() override {
        cout << "Dog barks" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Animal* a = new Dog();
    a->makeSound();  // Dog barks
    delete a;
    return 0;
}
```

### Conclusion

Java and C++ share many object-oriented features but differ in key areas such as memory management, multiple inheritance, and polymorphism. Java's automatic memory management and single inheritance model (with multiple inheritance through interfaces) simplify development and reduce errors, while C++ offers more control over memory and supports direct multiple inheritance, giving developers more flexibility at the cost of potentially increased complexity and the need for manual resource management.

#### 1. JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

- **Purpose**: The JVM is responsible for executing Java bytecode. It provides an environment for Java programs to run, converting bytecode into machine code and managing system memory and resources.
- **Role in Execution**: When you run the `GreetingApp` class, the JVM loads the class file, verifies the bytecode, and executes it. It handles tasks such as garbage collection and thread management.

#### 2. JRE (Java Runtime Environment)

- **Purpose**: The JRE provides the libraries, Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and other components necessary to run Java applications. It is essentially the runtime portion of Java software, which is all you need to run a Java program.
- **Role in Execution**: The JRE includes the JVM and the standard Java libraries required by the `GreetingApp` to run. When you execute the application, the JRE ensures that all the necessary components and libraries are available.

#### 3. JDK (Java Development Kit)

- **Purpose**: The JDK is a full-featured software development kit for Java, including the JRE, compilers, debuggers, and tools necessary for developing Java applications.
- **Role in Development**: The JDK includes the `javac` compiler, which you use to compile the `GreetingApp.java` file into bytecode (`GreetingApp.class`). It also includes tools like `javadoc` for documentation and `jdb` for debugging.
