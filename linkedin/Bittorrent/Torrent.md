## BitTorrent Inside Out: Building T

BitTorrent is one of the biggest contributions to engineering in the realm of data transfer and file sharing. This revolutionary protocol has transformed how we think about downloading and distributing large files, allowing for faster, more efficient, and decentralised sharing across the globe.

My aim is to bring you the best engineering stories, and BitTorrent is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful pieces of engineering I’ve encountered. Follow this series till the end, and you will be equipped to create your own torrent client, unlocking a deeper understanding of this remarkable technology that continues to inspire engineers worldwide.

Cheers!

Welcome to this edition of **BitTorrent Inside Out**! Throughout the series, I will share images and code snippets to illustrate key concepts. In the final article, I will provide a link to the complete working project for your reference.

After going through all the articles, you will be able to create your own torrent client in your favourite programming language. I’m using Go for this project because I like Gophers!
