# General Design Process 
**Phase 1: Need Identification**

1. **Identify Need:** This step involves recognizing the problem or opportunity that the design project aims to address. It includes gathering information through client meetings and project goals.
    
2. **Problem Definition:** Here, the problem statement is formulated based on the information collected. This involves defining the objectives that should be quantifiable and measurable.
    

**Phase 2: Conceptualization & Planning**

1. **Brainstorming:** This step encourages creative solutions through brainstorming sessions.
    
2. **Drawing/Visualization:** After brainstorming, initial ideas are sketched and visualized.
    
3. **Functional Decomposition:** The problem is broken down into smaller, more manageable components.
    
4. **Morphological Chart:** This tool helps explore different possible solutions by systematically combining various elements.
    
5. **Decision Making:** The most suitable solution is selected based on the established criteria.
    
6. **Gantt Charts & CPM:** A project schedule is created using Gantt charts or Critical Path Method (CPM) to plan and manage the design process.
    

**Phase 3: Detailed Design**

1. **Detailed Analysis:** This step involves a thorough investigation of the chosen design solution.
    
2. **Simulate & Optimize:** Here, simulations are used to assess the design's performance and identify areas for improvement.
    
3. **Detail Specifications:** Technical specifications are created to guide the development of the design.
    
4. **Drawings, GD&T:** Engineering drawings and Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T) symbols are created to precisely communicate the design requirements.
    

**Phase 4: Testing & Evaluation**

1. **Prototype Fabrication:** A prototype is built to physically represent the design and enable further testing.
    
2. **Evaluate Performance:** The prototype’s functionality and performance are assessed against the design objectives.
    
3. **Iterate Process Steps:** Based on the evaluation results, the design process may revisit earlier stages to address shortcomings.
    
4. **Report/Deliver:** Finally, a formal design report is created to document the entire process, and the final design is delivered to the client.


**Phase 1: Define the Problem**

1. **Identify Need:** This step involves recognizing the impetus for the design project. It could stem from client consultation, recognition of a market gap, or the identification of a problem that needs solving.
2. **Problem Definition:** Here, the problem is articulated clearly and concisely. What exactly needs to be addressed? What are the expectations?

**Phase 2: Conceptualization**

3. **Conceptualization & Planning:** Brainstorming potential solutions is central to this stage. This is where creative thinking is encouraged and a broad range of ideas are explored.
4. **Preliminary Design:** Following the brainstorming, this step translates the chosen concepts into initial sketches and visualizations. Specifications are noted, including materials and functionalities.

**Phase 3: Development**

5. **Detailed Design:** Here, the preliminary designs are further refined. Technical specifications are created and analyses are conducted to ensure the design meets expectations.
    
6. **Prototyping:** A prototype, a three-dimensional model, is constructed to test the design's functionality and usability.
    

**Phase 4: Evaluation**

7. **Testing/Evaluation:** The prototype is rigorously assessed to determine if it meets the design objectives. Does it function as intended?
    
8. **Report/Deliver:** The design process is documented in a formal report. This report includes the findings from the testing/evaluation phase.
    

**Iteration**

The flowchart also highlights that the design process is iterative. The “Iterate Process Steps 2-7 as Needed” box indicates that designers may need to revisit previous stages based on the results of the testing and evaluation phase.


# Human Centred Design 

HCD which is also known as human centred design has 5 steps - 

1 Empathise -  This is the first step of hcd. The purpose of this step is to conduct the interviews that give you an idea what people really care about. 
We need to empathize with their situations. 
*For eg*
If you want to help old age people, you might found out they want the ability to walk around.
In your conversation they might share with you different ways how you can do that 
Later in the interview dig down little deeper and, look for personal stories or situations where things become difficult.
Ideally you redo this process with other people with the same problem 

2 Define the Problem Statement - Looking at the interviews, you can understand the actual needs that people are trying to fulfil with certain activities.
One way to do this is by underlining the activities and the patterns people mentioned when they are talking about the problems. 
		• like going for a walk
		• meeting old friends for tea
		• simply going grocery shopping around the corner
		store
It's not much about going out its all about staying in touch.
After your analysis, formulate a problem statement:
**Some elderly are afraid to be lonely. The want to stay connected**

3 Ideate : Now focus on the problem statement only and come up with ideas that solve the problem.
The point is not to get a perfect idea, but rather to come up with as many ideas as possible.
This involves brainstorming sessions and sketching ideas. The goal is to come up with as many ideas as possible fostering creativity.
Like designing a old people friendly hoverboard and modified pushcar.
Whatever you have in your mind design it and and show it to the people whom you are trying to help and get their feedback.

4 Prototype : Now take a moment and look what you have learned from your conversations about different ideas.
Your solution could be a combination of the new idea and what is already being used in the market. 
Then connect the dots, sketch up your final solution and go build a real prototype that's just good enough to be tested.

5 Test : Now test your prototype with the actual users. 
Don't defend your ideas in case people didn't like it 
The aim is to learn what works and what not so any feedback is great. 
Then go back to ideation or prototyping and apply your learning.
Repeat the process until you have a prototype that works and solves the real problem..



# Mind Mapping 
Graphical representation of the information 
Used to represent how the ideas or other items are connected to the central idea and to each other. 
Mind maps are used to generate, visualise, structure, and classify ideas to look for patterns and insights that provide key design criteria.

Why Should I Mind Map?

• Mind maps structure information

• Mind maps enhance productivity

• Mind maps foster creativity

• Mind maps improve memory and recall

# SCAMPER 
Scamper is the technique used by many to ignite the silent creative genius lying inside them.

# Types of Design / Design Types
Conceptual Design is a process of designing at the earliest stage. In this process, a detailed outline of different design functions is figured out. The conceptual design includes designing different processes and interactions in a particular activity.

**Conceptual Design**
1 - Identification of customer needs - The goal of this is to identify the customer needs 
2 - Problem Definition - to create a statement that tells what has to be accomplished to satisfy the needs of the customer. This involves analysis of competitive products, the listing of constraints and trade-offs.
➢ Quality function deployment (QFD) - a valuable tool for linking customer needs with design requirements.
➢ Product Design Specification (PDS) - A detailed listing of the product requirements
3 - Gathering Information - To acquire broad information.
4 - Conceptualisation - It involves creating a broad set of concepts that satisfies the problem statement
5 - Concept Selection -  Evaluation of the design concepts, modifying and evolving into a single preferred concept, are the activities in this step.
6 - Refinement of the PDS : The product design specification is revisited after the concept has been selected. The design team must commit to achieving certain critical values of design parameters, usually called critical-to-quality (CTQ) parameters, and to living with trade-offs between cost and performance.
7 -  Design review : Before committing funds to move to the next design phase, a design review will be held. The design review will assure that the design is physically realisable and that it is economically worthwhile. It will also look at a detailed product-development schedule. This is needed to devise a strategy to minimise product cycle time and to identify the resources in people, equipment, and money needed to complete the project.

**Embodiment Design** 
The next phase of the design process is often called Embodiment Design . It is the phase where the design concept is invested with physical form, where we “**put meat on the bones**". Here the design is converted into the system or product. 

1 Product Architecture : It refers to the fundamental structure and arrangement of components within a physical product. The idea is to map the product's functions and features, rather than the product's physical design. Professionals can express a product's architecture using schematic diagrams or other visual aids.

***Types of product architecture*** 
Modular : It is focuses on the relationships between the various features of a product.These functions are described briefly, while the ways that they interact are described in depth.

❖ Integral: Integral architecture is just the opposite: it focuses on the function, purpose, and inner workings of each feature, with brief notes covering the relationships between them .

***Benefits of using product architecture***

❖ Highlighting features that are no longer useful so the team can remove and replace them

❖ Design team to customize the product depending on users' preferences and needs

❖ Making it possible to revise or reconfigure a module or element without impacting the entire project

❖ Developing sustainable products with dynamic capabilities and long lifespans

❖ Helping save time and reduce production costs

❖ Improving the functional performance of a product
