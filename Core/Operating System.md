**Long term Scheduler vs Short term Scheduler** 

Have you ever wondered how your CPU decides which programs on your hard drive to run from?  
  
A lot of programs are stored on the hard drive how does the CPU know which to execute first? Here the Scheduling Algorithms step in. A Scheduling Algorithm decides which process the CPU will access first.Â   
  
There are two types of Scheduling Algorithms -Â   
  
1 - Long-Term Scheduler - The long-term scheduler, or job scheduler, selects processes from the pool or HDD and loads them into memory(RAM) or ready queue for execution.  
  
2 - Short-Term Scheduler - The short-term scheduler, or CPU scheduler, selects from among the processes that are ready to execute and allocates the CPU to one of them.Â Its primary purpose is to decide which process from the ready queue gets the CPU next, based on various criteria.



Previously we have discussed about the intricacies of scheduling algorithm works exploring the journey of process from storage to the RAM or the Ready Queue and then from RAM to CPU. But now the question here is what is the process that we are moving ? ðŸ¤”
