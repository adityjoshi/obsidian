sieve of erato 
time complexity - O(N log Log N)
space complexity - O(N)

segmented sieve upper bound ka sqr root -
a) It requires a large amount of memory.
time O n , space - O(sqrt(n))

incremental sieve - works for small range only 

What is the formula for calculating the nth prime number using the Incremental Sieve algorithm?
n* n - n +1
