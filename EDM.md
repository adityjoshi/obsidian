# General Design Process 
**Phase 1: Need Identification**

1. **Identify Need:** This step involves recognizing the problem or opportunity that the design project aims to address. It includes gathering information through client meetings and project goals.
    
2. **Problem Definition:** Here, the problem statement is formulated based on the information collected. This involves defining the objectives that should be quantifiable and measurable.
    

**Phase 2: Conceptualization & Planning**

1. **Brainstorming:** This step encourages creative solutions through brainstorming sessions.
    
2. **Drawing/Visualization:** After brainstorming, initial ideas are sketched and visualized.
    
3. **Functional Decomposition:** The problem is broken down into smaller, more manageable components.
    
4. **Morphological Chart:** This tool helps explore different possible solutions by systematically combining various elements.
    
5. **Decision Making:** The most suitable solution is selected based on the established criteria.
    
6. **Gantt Charts & CPM:** A project schedule is created using Gantt charts or Critical Path Method (CPM) to plan and manage the design process.
    

**Phase 3: Detailed Design**

1. **Detailed Analysis:** This step involves a thorough investigation of the chosen design solution.
    
2. **Simulate & Optimize:** Here, simulations are used to assess the design's performance and identify areas for improvement.
    
3. **Detail Specifications:** Technical specifications are created to guide the development of the design.
    
4. **Drawings, GD&T:** Engineering drawings and Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T) symbols are created to precisely communicate the design requirements.
    

**Phase 4: Testing & Evaluation**

1. **Prototype Fabrication:** A prototype is built to physically represent the design and enable further testing.
    
2. **Evaluate Performance:** The prototype’s functionality and performance are assessed against the design objectives.
    
3. **Iterate Process Steps:** Based on the evaluation results, the design process may revisit earlier stages to address shortcomings.
    
4. **Report/Deliver:** Finally, a formal design report is created to document the entire process, and the final design is delivered to the client.


**Phase 1: Define the Problem**

1. **Identify Need:** This step involves recognizing the impetus for the design project. It could stem from client consultation, recognition of a market gap, or the identification of a problem that needs solving.
2. **Problem Definition:** Here, the problem is articulated clearly and concisely. What exactly needs to be addressed? What are the expectations?

**Phase 2: Conceptualization**

3. **Conceptualization & Planning:** Brainstorming potential solutions is central to this stage. This is where creative thinking is encouraged and a broad range of ideas are explored.
4. **Preliminary Design:** Following the brainstorming, this step translates the chosen concepts into initial sketches and visualizations. Specifications are noted, including materials and functionalities.

**Phase 3: Development**

5. **Detailed Design:** Here, the preliminary designs are further refined. Technical specifications are created and analyses are conducted to ensure the design meets expectations.
    
6. **Prototyping:** A prototype, a three-dimensional model, is constructed to test the design's functionality and usability.
    

**Phase 4: Evaluation**

7. **Testing/Evaluation:** The prototype is rigorously assessed to determine if it meets the design objectives. Does it function as intended?
    
8. **Report/Deliver:** The design process is documented in a formal report. This report includes the findings from the testing/evaluation phase.
    

**Iteration**

The flowchart also highlights that the design process is iterative. The “Iterate Process Steps 2-7 as Needed” box indicates that designers may need to revisit previous stages based on the results of the testing and evaluation phase.
