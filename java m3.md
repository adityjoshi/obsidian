# Design a Java program that handles multiple types of exceptions. Write a method that performs division and handles both ArithmeticException and NullPointerException. Explain the concept of exception hierarchy and how catch blocks should be ordered.

```java
public class ExceptionHandlingExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExceptionHandlingExample example = new ExceptionHandlingExample();

        // Test cases
        System.out.println(example.divide(10, 2));      // Normal case
        System.out.println(example.divide(10, 0));      // ArithmeticException case
        System.out.println(example.divide(null, 2));    // NullPointerException case
    }

    public Integer divide(Integer numerator, Integer denominator) {
        try {
            // Performing division
            return numerator / denominator;
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.");
            return null;
        } catch (NullPointerException e) {
            System.out.println("Error: One of the inputs is null.");
            return null;
        }
    }
}

```


### Explanation

1. **Method `divide`**:
    
    - This method takes two `Integer` objects as parameters: `numerator` and `denominator`.
    - It attempts to perform division `numerator / denominator`.
    - The method includes two `catch` blocks to handle specific exceptions:
        - **`ArithmeticException`**: Catches cases where division by zero occurs.
        - **`NullPointerException`**: Catches cases where either the numerator or denominator is `null`.
2. **Test Cases**:
    
    - The `main` method tests the `divide` method with different scenarios: a normal case, division by zero, and null input.

### Concept of Exception Hierarchy

- **Exception Hierarchy**:
    
    - In Java, exceptions are organised in a hierarchy, with `Throwable` at the top.
    - `Exception` is a subclass of `Throwable`, and `RuntimeException` is a subclass of `Exception`.
    - Specific exceptions like `ArithmeticException` and `NullPointerException` are subclasses of `RuntimeException`.
- **Ordering of Catch Blocks**:
    
    - Catch blocks should be ordered from the most specific exceptions to the most general.
    - This is because Java matches exceptions in the order they appear in the catch blocks.
    - If a more general exception type is caught first, it would also catch its subclasses, preventing the more specific catch block from executing.

# Analyze the differences between the throw and throws keywords in Java. Provide examples of their usage and discuss scenarios where each would be appropriate.

The `throw` and `throws` keywords in Java are both related to exception handling, but they serve different purposes. Let’s analyze the differences between them, provide examples, and discuss scenarios where each would be appropriate.

### Differences Between `throw` and `throws`

| **Aspect**            | **`throw`**                                                                                            | **`throws`**                                                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Purpose**           | Used to explicitly throw an exception.                                                                 | Declares that a method might throw an exception.                         |
| **Usage**             | Inside a method or block to throw an exception.                                                        | In the method signature to indicate possible exceptions.                 |
| **Type of Exception** | Can throw any instance of `Throwable` (checked or unchecked).                                          | Can declare checked exceptions only (unchecked exceptions are optional). |
| **Where Used**        | Within the body of a method.                                                                           | In the method declaration.                                               |
| **Effect**            | Terminates the current flow and transfers control to the nearest catch block or propagates it further. | Alerts the caller of the method that an exception may be thrown.         |

### Examples of `throw` and `throws`

#### 1. **`throw` Example**

The `throw` keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception from a method or block of code.

```java
public class ThrowExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            validateAge(15);
        } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
            System.out.println("Caught exception: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }

    public static void validateAge(int age) {
        if (age < 18) {
            // Throwing an unchecked exception (IllegalArgumentException)
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Age must be 18 or older.");
        }
        System.out.println("Age is valid.");
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The `validateAge` method checks if the age is less than 18. If it is, it explicitly throws an `IllegalArgumentException` using the `throw` keyword.
- The `throw` keyword is used to trigger an exception when a specific condition is met.
- The exception is caught in the `main` method using a try-catch block.

#### 2. **`throws` Example**

The `throws` keyword is used in a method signature to declare that a method may throw one or more exceptions.

```java
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
import java.io.FileReader;

public class ThrowsExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            readFile("nonexistentfile.txt");
        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
            System.out.println("Caught exception: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }

    // Declaring that this method throws a FileNotFoundException
    public static void readFile(String fileName) throws FileNotFoundException {
        FileReader file = new FileReader(fileName);
        System.out.println("File opened successfully.");
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The `readFile` method is declared with `throws FileNotFoundException`, indicating that it might throw this checked exception.
- If the file does not exist, a `FileNotFoundException` is thrown when attempting to create a `FileReader` object.
- The calling method (`main`) must handle or propagate this exception, hence it is caught using a try-catch block.

### Scenarios Where Each is Appropriate

#### **When to Use `throw`**
- **Condition-based Exception Handling**: Use `throw` when you want to explicitly throw an exception based on a specific condition or when an unexpected situation occurs in your code. For example, throwing an `IllegalArgumentException` if a method receives an invalid argument.
- **Custom Exceptions**: Use `throw` to create and throw custom exceptions that provide more specific error details.

#### **When to Use `throws`**
- **Method Declaration**: Use `throws` in the method signature when a method might throw a checked exception that it does not handle itself. This forces the caller to handle or declare the exception.
- **Propagating Exceptions**: Use `throws` to propagate exceptions to higher levels of the call stack, where they can be handled appropriately. This is often used in methods that interact with I/O, networking, or other resources where checked exceptions are common.

### Conclusion

- **`throw`** is used within a method to trigger an exception when something goes wrong.
- **`throws`** is used in a method signature to declare that the method might throw one or more exceptions, informing the caller to handle them.
- The proper use of `throw` and `throws` is crucial for robust and maintainable error handling in Java applications. 

# Given a Java method that may throw multiple exceptions, write code that uses a single catch block to handle different exceptions using multi-catch. Discuss how multi-catch improves code readability and maintenance.

Let's consider a different example involving string manipulation and arithmetic operations. The program will try to parse an integer from a string and then perform a division operation, handling possible exceptions using multi-catch.

### Java Program with Multi-Catch Example

```java
public class MultiCatchExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String[] numbers = {"10", "0", "invalid"};

        for (String number : numbers) {
            try {
                // Attempt to parse the string to an integer
                int parsedNumber = Integer.parseInt(number);
                
                // Attempt to perform division
                int result = 100 / parsedNumber;
                System.out.println("Result: " + result);
                
            // Multi-catch block to handle NumberFormatException and ArithmeticException
            } catch (NumberFormatException | ArithmeticException e) {
                System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Input Data**:
   - The program iterates over an array of strings (`numbers`) containing different values: `"10"`, `"0"`, and `"invalid"`.
   - `"10"` is a valid number, `"0"` will cause a division by zero, and `"invalid"` is a string that cannot be parsed into an integer.

2. **Try Block**:
   - The program attempts to parse each string into an integer using `Integer.parseInt(number)`.
   - It then tries to divide `100` by the parsed number.

3. **Multi-Catch Block**:
   - **`NumberFormatException`**: This exception is thrown if the string cannot be converted to an integer (e.g., the `"invalid"` string).
   - **`ArithmeticException`**: This exception is thrown if there is an attempt to divide by zero (e.g., when the parsed number is `0`).
   - The multi-catch block handles both exceptions and prints an appropriate error message using `e.getMessage()`.

4. **Output**:
   - For `"10"`, the output will be the result of `100 / 10`, which is `10`.
   - For `"0"`, the output will indicate an arithmetic error (division by zero).
   - For `"invalid"`, the output will indicate a number format error (unable to parse the string as an integer).

### Benefits of Multi-Catch in This Example

1. **Simplified Error Handling**:
   - The multi-catch block allows both `NumberFormatException` and `ArithmeticException` to be handled together, reducing the need for multiple catch blocks.

2. **Readability**:
   - The code is easier to read because related exceptions are grouped together. This makes it clear that both parsing and arithmetic operations are being monitored for potential errors.

3. **Maintenance**:
   - If you need to change the handling logic, you only need to modify one catch block, ensuring consistent behavior across different types of exceptions.

### Conclusion

Using multi-catch in scenarios like this helps keep the code concise and easier to maintain, while still effectively handling different types of exceptions that may arise from a single block of code. It’s especially useful when the exceptions share similar handling requirements.

# Write a Java program to create and start multiple threads. Implement the Runnable interface and extend the Thread class to demonstrate both approaches. Discuss the differences and use cases for each method of thread creation.

using runnable 
```java
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is running (Runnable).");
    }
}

public class RunnableExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(new MyRunnable());

        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
    }
}

```

extending the thread class
```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println(getName() + " is running (Thread).");
    }
}

public class ThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread thread1 = new MyThread();
        MyThread thread2 = new MyThread();

        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
    }
}

```

### Differences and Use Cases

#### **1. Implementing the `Runnable` Interface**

- **Multiple Inheritance**: Since Java does not support multiple inheritance, implementing `Runnable` is beneficial when your class needs to inherit from another class. You can only extend one class, but you can implement multiple interfaces.
    
- **Loose Coupling**: Implementing `Runnable` keeps the task separate from the thread execution. This promotes better separation of concerns, as the task logic is defined in a class implementing `Runnable`, and the thread execution is handled by the `Thread` class.
    
- **Use Cases**:
    
    - When your class already extends another class and you need to implement threading.
    - When you want to define the task logic separately from the thread management.

#### **2. Extending the `Thread` Class**

- **Simple to Use**: Extending the `Thread` class is straightforward and may seem easier for beginners. The task and thread management are encapsulated within a single class.
    
- **Tightly Coupled**: Extending `Thread` tightly couples the task logic with thread execution. This approach is less flexible because the thread logic and execution are not separated.
    
- **Use Cases**:
    
    - When you need to override or extend the functionality of the `Thread` class itself.
    - For simple use cases where you don't need the flexibility provided by implementing `Runnable`.

### Summary

- **Runnable Interface**: Preferred when you need flexibility, reusability, and separation of concerns, especially if your class needs to extend another class.
- **Thread Class**: Can be used for simplicity and when there’s no need for your class to extend another class.

Both methods are valid, and the choice depends on your specific use case and design preferences.

# Compare and contrast the different states in the thread life cycle in Java. Provide examples of methods that transition a thread from one state to another and discuss the implications of these transitions.

In Java, a thread can be in one of several states during its life cycle. The `Thread.State` enum defines these states, which reflect the thread's current activity. Understanding these states helps manage thread behavior and performance. Let's explore the different thread states, their transitions, and some examples of methods that cause these transitions.

### Thread Life Cycle States

1. **NEW**
2. **RUNNABLE**
3. **BLOCKED**
4. **WAITING**
5. **TIMED_WAITING**
6. **TERMINATED**

### 1. **NEW**

- **Description**: The thread is in the `NEW` state when it is created but not yet started. It hasn't been scheduled for execution by the JVM.
- **Transition**: 
  - **Start**: Calling the `start()` method transitions the thread to the `RUNNABLE` state.

- **Example**:
  ```java
  Thread thread = new Thread(() -> System.out.println("Thread is running"));
  // The thread is in NEW state here
  ```

### 2. **RUNNABLE**

- **Description**: Once a thread is started, it enters the `RUNNABLE` state. This state indicates that the thread is ready to run and is waiting for CPU time.
- **Transition**: 
  - **Scheduler**: The thread may run when the CPU schedules it, but it can also transition back to `RUNNABLE` after being blocked, waiting, or sleeping.

- **Example**:
  ```java
  thread.start(); // Transitions from NEW to RUNNABLE
  ```

### 3. **BLOCKED**

- **Description**: A thread enters the `BLOCKED` state when it tries to enter a synchronized block or method and the lock is not available.
- **Transition**:
  - **Lock Acquisition**: The thread transitions back to `RUNNABLE` once it acquires the lock.

- **Example**:
  ```java
  synchronized(lock) {
      // Thread enters BLOCKED state if lock is held by another thread
  }
  ```

### 4. **WAITING**

- **Description**: A thread enters the `WAITING` state when it calls a method that waits indefinitely for another thread to perform a particular action (like `Object.wait()`, `Thread.join()` without a timeout, or `LockSupport.park()`).
- **Transition**: 
  - **Notification**: It returns to the `RUNNABLE` state when another thread calls `notify()`, `notifyAll()`, or when the waiting thread is interrupted.

- **Example**:
  ```java
  synchronized(lock) {
      lock.wait(); // Thread enters WAITING state
  }
  ```

### 5. **TIMED_WAITING**

- **Description**: This state is similar to `WAITING`, but the thread enters `TIMED_WAITING` when it waits for a specified amount of time (using methods like `Thread.sleep()`, `Object.wait(long timeout)`, or `Thread.join(long millis)`).
- **Transition**:
  - **Timeout/Notification**: The thread returns to `RUNNABLE` after the specified time elapses or when it is notified.

- **Example**:
  ```java
  Thread.sleep(1000); // Thread enters TIMED_WAITING state
  ```

### 6. **TERMINATED**

- **Description**: A thread enters the `TERMINATED` state once its `run()` method completes or when it is explicitly terminated using `stop()` (though `stop()` is deprecated and not recommended).
- **Transition**: 
  - **Completion**: The thread finishes executing its task or is terminated.

- **Example**:
  ```java
  // Once the run method completes, the thread transitions to TERMINATED
  ```

### Transitions Between States

- **NEW → RUNNABLE**: Occurs when `start()` is called on a thread.
- **RUNNABLE → BLOCKED**: Happens when a thread tries to enter a synchronized block and the lock is not available.
- **BLOCKED → RUNNABLE**: When the lock is released and the thread acquires it.
- **RUNNABLE → WAITING**: Happens when a thread calls `wait()`, `join()` (without a timeout), or `LockSupport.park()`.
- **WAITING → RUNNABLE**: When another thread calls `notify()`, `notifyAll()`, or `interrupt()`.
- **RUNNABLE → TIMED_WAITING**: Occurs when a thread calls `sleep()`, `wait(timeout)`, `join(timeout)`, or `LockSupport.parkNanos()` or `parkUntil()`.
- **TIMED_WAITING → RUNNABLE**: After the timeout period ends or when notified.
- **RUNNABLE → TERMINATED**: When the thread completes execution or is explicitly stopped.

### Implications of These Transitions

- **Resource Management**: Understanding the state transitions helps manage resources effectively. For instance, knowing when threads are in `WAITING` or `BLOCKED` states can help identify bottlenecks.
- **Concurrency Issues**: Mismanagement of state transitions, such as improper use of synchronization (leading to deadlock), can cause significant concurrency problems.
- **Performance Optimization**: Avoiding unnecessary state transitions (e.g., minimizing blocking operations) can lead to more efficient thread management and better application performance.
  
### Conclusion

The thread life cycle in Java is a critical concept for managing multithreaded applications. The correct use of thread states and understanding their transitions can help avoid common pitfalls such as deadlocks, race conditions, and inefficient resource usage. By effectively managing threads, you can create responsive, efficient, and robust Java applications.
